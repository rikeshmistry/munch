      <h3>Homemade Granola</h3>
      <p>
        Homemade granola is one of those recipes that I make in big batches, I store it in big kilner jars and use it in my breakfast almost every day! I like to eat it layered with a thick yogurt (I like coconut yogurt but any thick greek one is

      <h3>Pan Fried Trout and Fennel Salad</h3>
      <p>
        Fennel brings a level of decadence to any recipe, sliced properly, it looks like beautiful curled riboons knotted within your dish. This warm pan fried rainbow trout and fennel salad is a fairly luxurious dinner whilst being quick and easy to
        make. It makes and ideal mideweek meal and if you wait until the last minute to add the baby watercress...<a href="#">Read more</a>
